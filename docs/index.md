## **Expertise** ##

### Underwater Robotics Mechanical Design ###

My experience lies in engineering robust robotic designs for complex maritime environments, ensuring  maneuverability and data acquisition capabilities.

### Advanced Underwater Photogrammetry ###

I leverage cutting-edge photogrammetry techniques to generate high-resolution 3D models of underwater structures and ecosystems, driving scientific research and environmental monitoring using AUVs, as well as action and digital cameras.
Robotic Positioning & Navigation: My doctorate focused on enhancing robotic positioning algorithms using probabilistic methods and accelerometers in GPS-denied environments, particularly for pipe inspection applications.

## **Impact** ##

My work has contributed to the development of Hydrus, a micro AUV. I have also been involved in projects monitoriing of coral reefs and submerged shipwrecks.

I am actively involved in the Perth maritime archeology community, collaborating with researchers and industry players to advance the field of underwater exploration and surveying.

## **Passion** ##

Beyond the workshop, you'll find me immersed in the very environment my robots explore. Whether diving through coral gardens, navigating challenging currents, or simply appreciating the ocean, my connection to the sea fuels my passion and inspires my innovation.
