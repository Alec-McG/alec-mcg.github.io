## Bio

<img align="left" width="200" height="200" src="images/headshot.jpg ">

I am an R&D engineer with a passion for robotics and automation. 

I am currently a Robotics Hardware engineer where I specialise in robotics for maritime environments and underwater photogrammetry. 

My Engineering Doctorate Thesis was in improving robotic positioning algorithms using probabilistic methods in gps denied environments and IMUs, specifically looking at pipe inspection applications. 

In my spare time I can usually be found in the ocean, whether it be for diving, surfing, snorkeling or chilling at the beach.
